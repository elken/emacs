;;; Commentary:
;;; Currently my $WORKLANG, this will end up having a fair amount of
;;; config. A lot of the power will come from LSP, and I lean quite a
;;; bit on that.
;;; Code:

(use-package rbenv
  :defer t
  :hook ((ruby-ts-mode ruby-mode) . global-rbenv-mode))

(use-package rspec-mode
  :custom
  (rspec-use-spring-when-possible nil)
  :config
  (defadvice rspec-compile (around rspec-compile-around)
    "Use BASH shell for running the specs because of ZSH issues."
    (let ((shell-file-name "/bin/bash"))
      ad-do-it))

  (ad-activate 'rspec-compile))

(provide 'lkn-ruby)
;;; lkn-ruby.el ends here
